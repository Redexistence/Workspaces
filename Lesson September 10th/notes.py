# Data Structures are different ways of organizing data on your computer so that it can be used efficiently.
# Algorithms are a set of steps to accomplish a specific task.
# Set of rules'commands for a computer program to accomplish a task. An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems
# Algorithm is not the complete code or program, it is just the core logic(solution) of a problem, which can be expressed either as an informal high level as pseudocode or using a flowchart.
# What makes a good algorithm?
# 1. Correctness
# 2. Efficiency
# An algorithm is said to be efficient and fast, it if takes less time to execute and consumes less memory space. The performance of an algorithm is measured on the basis of following properties:
# - Time Complexity:
#  The total time required by the program to run to completion.
# - Space Complexity:
#  The total space or memory required by the program to run to completion.
