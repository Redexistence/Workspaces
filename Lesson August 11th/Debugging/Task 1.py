# Testing the function
travel_time(120)  # Output: You have 2 hours and 0 minutes.
travel_time(1500)  # Output: You have 25 days, 0 hours, and 0 minutes.
travel_time(6300)  # Output: You have 10 hours, 30 minutes.
travel_time(34) # Output: You have 34 minutes.
# Why this code is not working as expected:
# The code is not correctly handling the minutes greater than 60. It should print hours and minutes separately.
# The code is not correctly handling the minutes greater than 24 hours. It should print days, hours, and minutes separately.
# The code is not correctly handling the minutes equal to 60. It should print hours and minutes separately.
# The code is not correctly handling the minutes equal to 0. It should print nothing.
# This code is not executing line 4 because 60*24 also fits in the >60 condition. So, it prints the remaining minutes as is.
